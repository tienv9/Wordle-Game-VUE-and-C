* This is a Copy of my group project together with my partner kinpark (https://github.com/kinpark) and is pulled from this repository (https://github.com/kinpark/EWU-CSCD379-2023-Spring/tree/final)

* This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game with an implementation like Menu, Create an account, Sign in, log in, Leaderboard, basic bot, and simple instruction page on how to play.
* The game is designed for 2 players using the same computer but can also be played with an easy or hard bot.

* To access the game, open folder tictactoe-web with something like Visual Studio Code with the correct extension and run with 'npm run dev' 
* Then open and run Wordle.Api solution to have access to the backend of the game to allow access to functions like login and Leaderboard.
